# Algorithms

This project explores and visualizes some interesting  algorithms:

# Genetic Algorithm

This part of the project shows a _genetic algorithm_ evolution on the traveling salesman problem. 

## Maze Generator & PathFinder

This part of the project uses the _Prim Algorithm_ to create a maze.

The maze can then be solved via the _A* Algorithm_, which finds a path between the randomly genrated starting point of the maze and the end point of the maze generation.
